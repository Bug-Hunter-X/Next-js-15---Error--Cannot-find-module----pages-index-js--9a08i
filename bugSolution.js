```javascript
// pages/index.js

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>Hello world!</div>
  );
}
```
No code changes are needed in `pages/index.js`.  The issue is likely related to Next.js configuration or dependencies.  A potential solution (though it might not apply to all cases) involves verifying correct project setup and ensuring compatibility with Next.js 15 via their official documentation and troubleshooting resources.
